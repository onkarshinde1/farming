    <h1>Tomato Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/tomato.jpg" alt="tomato">
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Tomatoes are commonly grown from seeds or seedlings. If starting from seeds, plant them indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Sow seeds in seed trays or pots filled with seed-starting mix, keeping them moist and warm until they germinate. Once seedlings have developed a few sets of true leaves, transplant them into larger pots.</p>
    
    <h2>Transplanting</h2>
    <p>Transplant tomato seedlings into the garden after the danger of frost has passed and soil temperatures have warmed to at least 55°F. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Space tomato plants 18-24 inches apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart. Plant seedlings deeply, burying the stem up to the first set of leaves to encourage strong root development.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>Tomato plants require consistent watering, at least 1-2 inches per week, to prevent blossom-end rot and cracking. Mulch around plants to help retain soil moisture and suppress weeds. As tomato plants grow, provide support with stakes, cages, or trellises to keep the plants upright and improve air circulation, reducing the risk of diseases. Tomato flowers are self-pollinating but may benefit from gentle shaking to ensure thorough pollination.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Watering: Water tomato plants deeply and evenly to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water at the base of the plant to prevent foliage diseases. Avoid overhead watering, especially in the evening, to reduce the risk of fungal diseases.<br>
       • Fertilization: Fertilize tomato plants with a balanced fertilizer or compost when planting and again once fruit begins to set. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can result in lush foliage at the expense of fruit production.<br>
       • Pruning: Remove suckers that form in the crotch between the main stem and branches to encourage larger fruit and improve air circulation. Prune off any yellow or diseased leaves promptly to prevent the spread of disease.<br>
       • Pest and Disease Management: Monitor plants regularly for pests such as aphids, hornworms, and tomato fruitworms. Handpick larger pests and treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Rotate tomato crops annually and practice good garden hygiene to reduce the risk of diseases such as early blight and late blight.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Tomatoes can be harvested when they reach full color and are firm but slightly soft to the touch. Pick tomatoes regularly to encourage continued fruit production. Use sharp scissors or pruning shears to cut tomatoes from the vine, leaving a small portion of the stem attached. Store harvested tomatoes at room temperature away from direct sunlight to ripen fully. For extended storage, harvest tomatoes slightly underripe and allow them to ripen indoors.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store ripe tomatoes at room temperature for up to one week. Avoid storing tomatoes in the refrigerator, as cold temperatures can diminish flavor and texture. Use ripe tomatoes promptly or preserve them by canning, freezing, or drying for later use. To freeze tomatoes, wash and core them, then blanch in boiling water for 30 seconds before plunging into ice water. Peel off the skins, pack whole or chopped tomatoes into freezer bags, and freeze for up to 12 months.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>There are thousands of tomato varieties available, ranging in size, shape, color, and flavor. Popular varieties include 'Beefsteak,' 'Roma,' 'Cherry,' 'Heirloom,' and 'Early Girl.' Choose varieties suited to your climate, growing conditions, and culinary preferences. Heirloom tomatoes offer unique flavors and colors, while determinate varieties are compact and suitable for container gardening.</p>
    
    <h2>Companion Planting</h2>
    <p>Tomatoes benefit from companion planting with herbs such as basil, parsley, and chives, which can help deter pests and improve flavor. Marigolds planted around tomato plants can repel nematodes and other harmful insects. Avoid planting tomatoes near potatoes, peppers, or eggplants, as they are susceptible to similar pests and diseases.</p>
    
    <h2>Propagation</h2>
    <p>Tomatoes can be propagated from seeds or cuttings. Save seeds from ripe tomatoes by removing them from the pulp, rinsing, and drying them thoroughly before storing in a cool, dry place. Cuttings can be taken from healthy tomato plants and rooted in water or potting mix to produce new plants. Choose vigorous, disease-free plants for propagation to ensure success.</p>
