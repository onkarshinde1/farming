    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Seeds should be planted in nutrient-rich soil indoors or in a greenhouse about 8-10 weeks before the last expected frost date in your area. Sow the seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist until germination.</p>
    
    <h2>Germination</h2>
    <p>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Germination typically occurs within 7-14 days. Once the seedlings emerge, provide them with ample light, preferably from grow lights or by placing them in a sunny location.</p>
    
    <h2>Transplanting</h2>
    <p>When seedlings have developed at least two sets of true leaves and all risk of frost has passed, they can be transplanted into larger pots or directly into the garden. Space plants 18-24 inches apart in rows spaced 24-36 inches apart.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Water: Bell peppers need consistent moisture, so water regularly, especially during dry periods. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid waterlogging.<br>
       • Fertilization: Fertilize plants with a balanced fertilizer high in phosphorus to promote fruiting. Apply fertilizer every 2-3 weeks, following package instructions.<br>
       • Support: Provide support for the plants as they grow, especially if they are heavy with fruit. Stake or cage the plants to prevent them from bending or breaking under the weight of the peppers.<br>
       • Pruning: Pinch off early flowers to encourage the plant to focus on vegetative growth before setting fruit. Remove any damaged or diseased foliage to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Bell peppers can be harvested when they reach their mature size and color. They can be picked green or left on the plant to ripen to yellow, orange, or red. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the peppers from the plant, taking care not to damage the stems or nearby fruit. Harvest regularly to encourage continued fruit production throughout the season.</p>
    
    <h2>Pest and Disease Management</h2>
    <p>Common pests of bell peppers include aphids, spider mites, and hornworms. Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation and treat with insecticidal soap or neem oil if necessary. Diseases such as blossom end rot and bacterial spot can also affect bell peppers. Practice crop rotation, provide adequate air circulation, and avoid overhead watering to reduce the risk of disease.</p>
