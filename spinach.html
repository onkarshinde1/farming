    <h1>Spinach Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/SPINACH.jpeg" alt="spinach">
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Spinach seeds can be directly sown into well-prepared garden soil or started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last expected frost date in your area. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until germination. Optimal soil temperature for germination is between 50-75°F.</p>
    
    <h2>Germination</h2>
    <p>Germination typically occurs within 7-14 days when soil temperatures are between 50-75°F. Once seedlings emerge, thin them to 4-6 inches apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation. Spinach prefers cooler temperatures and may bolt in hot weather.</p>
    
    <h2>Transplanting</h2>
    <p>If started indoors, transplant spinach seedlings into the garden once they have developed 2-3 true leaves and all risk of frost has passed. Harden off seedlings by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions over 7-10 days before transplanting. Space transplants 4-6 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Spinach can also be grown in containers.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Water: Spinach plants need consistent moisture, so water regularly, especially during dry periods. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid waterlogging. Water at the base of plants to prevent leaf diseases.<br>
       • Fertilization: Spinach is a heavy feeder and benefits from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer or compost before planting and side-dress with nitrogen fertilizer every 3-4 weeks during the growing season. Avoid excessive nitrogen as it can lead to lush foliage but poor flavor.<br>
       • Mulching: Mulch around spinach plants to help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth. Use organic mulches such as straw or shredded leaves. Mulching also helps regulate soil temperature and prevents soil splash on leaves.<br>
       • Pest Control: Monitor plants regularly for pests such as aphids, leaf miners, and slugs. Handpick larger pests and treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Row covers can be used to protect plants from pests.<br>
       • Disease Management: Practice crop rotation and provide adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of diseases such as downy mildew and leaf spot. Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Harvest spinach when the leaves are large enough to eat, typically 4-6 inches long. Pick outer leaves first, leaving the inner leaves to continue growing. Cut or pinch off leaves at the base of the stem. Harvest regularly to encourage continued leaf production. Spinach can be harvested as baby spinach or mature leaves.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store harvested spinach in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper drawer. Spinach is best eaten fresh but can also be blanched and frozen for long-term storage. Wash spinach thoroughly before storing to remove any dirt or debris.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>Popular spinach varieties include 'Bloomsdale,' 'Space,' 'Tyee,' and 'Melody.' Choose varieties suited to your climate and growing conditions. Some varieties are more resistant to bolting or disease.</p>
    
    <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
    <p>Spinach is rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as folate, iron, and calcium. It is a nutritious addition to salads, smoothies, soups, and stir-fries. Regular consumption of spinach may help lower the risk of chronic diseases and promote overall health.</p>
