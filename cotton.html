    <h1>Cotton Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/cotton.jpg" alt="cotton">
    <h2>Planting</h2>
    <p>Cotton is typically planted in spring after the danger of frost has passed and soil temperatures reach around 60°F (15°C). Planting dates vary depending on the region and climate. Cotton seeds should be planted in well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7.5. Rows are usually spaced 36 to 40 inches apart, and seeds are planted about 0.5 to 1 inch deep. Adequate spacing between plants is crucial for proper growth and development.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>After planting, cotton seeds germinate within 5 to 10 days under optimal conditions. Once germinated, cotton plants develop a series of leaves and begin to grow rapidly. During the vegetative stage, cotton plants focus on developing a robust root system and foliage. Flowering typically begins around 60 to 90 days after planting, depending on the cotton variety and environmental conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Fertilization</h2>
    <p>Fertilization is crucial for cotton production, as it directly impacts yield and fiber quality. Soil testing before planting helps determine nutrient deficiencies and guides fertilizer application. Nitrogen is a key nutrient for cotton and is typically applied in split applications throughout the growing season. Phosphorus and potassium are also important for cotton growth and should be applied according to soil test recommendations.</p>
    
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p>• Weed Control: Weed management is essential in cotton production to reduce competition for nutrients, water, and light. Herbicides are commonly used for weed control, but cultivation and hand-weeding may also be necessary, especially in organic cotton production.<br>
       • Pest Management: Cotton is susceptible to various pests, including aphids, bollworms, and thrips. Integrated pest management (IPM) practices, including crop rotation, insecticides, and beneficial insect conservation, help manage pest populations and minimize yield losses.<br>
       • Disease Management: Cotton diseases such as Fusarium wilt, Verticillium wilt, and cotton root rot can impact yield and fiber quality. Disease-resistant cotton varieties and cultural practices such as crop rotation, planting disease-free seed, and managing irrigation can help mitigate disease pressure.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Cotton bolls mature approximately 120 to 180 days after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions. Bolls gradually open as they mature, revealing fluffy white cotton fibers. Harvesting typically occurs in late summer or early fall when the majority of bolls have opened. Mechanical harvesters strip the cotton from the plants, and the harvested cotton undergoes ginning to separate the fibers from the seeds.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Once harvested and ginned, cotton fibers are compressed into bales for storage and transport. Cotton bales are stored in warehouses or gins until they are sold to textile mills for processing. Proper storage conditions, including controlled temperature and humidity, are essential for maintaining fiber quality and preventing damage from moisture and pests.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>There are numerous cotton varieties available, each with specific characteristics suited to different growing regions and production systems. Popular cotton varieties include 'DeltaPine 1646,' 'Phytogen 72,' 'Stoneville 4946GLB2,' and 'FiberMax 1830GLT.'</p>
