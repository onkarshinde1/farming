    <h1>Radish Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/RADISH.jpeg" alt="radish">
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Radishes are typically grown from seeds directly sown into well-prepared garden soil. Plant seeds ½ inch deep and space them 1-2 inches apart in rows spaced 6-12 inches apart. Radish seeds germinate quickly, usually within 4-7 days when soil temperatures are between 50-70°F. For successive harvests, sow radish seeds every 2-3 weeks throughout the growing season. Choose a radish variety based on desired size, flavor, and color.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>Radish plants grow quickly and are ready for harvest within 3-4 weeks after planting. They prefer cool temperatures and thrive in full sun to partial shade. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged to prevent radishes from becoming pithy or splitting. Thin radish seedlings to 2-3 inches apart once they have developed their first true leaves to allow for proper root development. Radish foliage is edible and can be used in salads.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Watering: Radishes need regular watering to ensure tender, crisp roots. Water consistently, especially during dry periods, and aim to keep the soil evenly moist. Avoid overhead watering to prevent foliar diseases.<br>
       • Fertilization: Radishes are light feeders and typically do not require additional fertilization if planted in fertile soil. However, if soil fertility is poor, amend with compost or a balanced fertilizer before planting.<br>
       • Mulching: Mulch around radish plants to help retain soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and regulate soil temperature. Use organic mulches such as straw or shredded leaves. Mulching also helps prevent soil compaction and erosion.<br>
       • Pest and Disease Management: Monitor plants regularly for pests such as flea beetles, aphids, and root maggots. Handpick larger pests and treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Row covers can be used to protect plants from pests. Practice crop rotation and provide adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of diseases such as damping-off and root rot.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Radishes can be harvested when they reach the desired size, usually 1-2 inches in diameter, depending on the variety. Pull radishes from the soil gently to avoid damaging the roots. Harvest radishes promptly once they reach maturity, as they can become woody or pithy if left in the ground too long. Remove any damaged or diseased radishes to prevent the spread of pests and diseases. Wash harvested radishes thoroughly before consuming.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store harvested radishes in the refrigerator crisper drawer. Remove tops to prevent moisture loss and place radishes in a perforated plastic bag or container lined with a damp paper towel to maintain freshness. Radishes are best eaten fresh but can also be pickled or sliced and added to salads and other dishes. Properly stored radishes can last up to several weeks.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>Popular radish varieties include 'Cherry Belle,' 'French Breakfast,' 'Easter Egg,' and 'White Icicle.' Choose varieties suited to your climate, growing conditions, and desired flavor and appearance. Experiment with different colors and shapes to add visual interest to your garden and culinary creations. Some varieties are more tolerant of heat or cold, while others have unique flavor profiles.</p>
    
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>Radishes are versatile and can be used in a variety of culinary applications. They can be eaten raw as a crunchy snack, sliced and added to salads, pickled for longer storage, or cooked in soups and stir-fries. Radish greens are also edible and can be used in salads or cooked as a nutritious side dish. Radishes are low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them a healthy addition to any diet.</p>
