    <h1>Cucumber Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/CUCUMBER.jpeg" alt="cucumber">
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Cucumber seeds should be sown directly into well-drained, nutrient-rich soil once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 60°F. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart in rows spaced 3-5 feet apart. Cucumber seeds can also be started indoors 3-4 weeks before transplanting. Before sowing, soak seeds in water for a few hours to improve germination rates.</p>
    
    <h2>Germination</h2>
    <p>Germination typically occurs within 7-10 days when soil temperatures are between 70-95°F. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Once seedlings emerge, thin them to the desired spacing to promote healthy growth and adequate air circulation. Thin to the healthiest seedlings, leaving the strongest ones.</p>
    
    <h2>Transplanting</h2>
    <p>If starting seeds indoors, transplant cucumber seedlings into the garden once they have developed 2-3 true leaves and all risk of frost has passed. Harden off seedlings by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions over 7-10 days before transplanting. Space transplants 12-24 inches apart in rows spaced 3-5 feet apart. Cucumber plants are sensitive to root disturbance, so handle seedlings carefully during transplanting.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Water: Cucumber plants need consistent moisture, so water regularly, especially during dry periods. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid waterlogging. Water at the base of plants to prevent leaf diseases.<br>
       • Fertilization: Cucumbers are heavy feeders and benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer or compost before planting and side-dress with nitrogen fertilizer every 3-4 weeks during the growing season. Avoid excessive nitrogen as it can lead to lush foliage but poor fruiting.<br>
       • Mulching: Mulch around cucumber plants to help retain soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and prevent soil splash on leaves. Use organic mulches such as straw or shredded leaves. Mulching also helps regulate soil temperature and conserves soil moisture.<br>
       • Trellising: Cucumber plants can be trained to grow vertically on trellises or supports to save space, promote air circulation, and keep fruits clean and straight. Install trellises at planting time and train vines as they grow. Trellising also reduces the risk of fruit rot and makes harvesting easier.<br>
       • Pest Control: Monitor plants regularly for pests such as cucumber beetles, aphids, and spider mites. Handpick larger pests and treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Row covers can be used to protect plants from pests. Floating row covers can also be used to protect young plants from pests and provide some frost protection.<br>
       • Disease Management: Practice crop rotation and provide adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of diseases such as powdery mildew and bacterial wilt. Remove and destroy infected plant debris promptly. Apply fungicides preventatively if diseases are a recurring problem in your area.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Harvest cucumbers when they reach the desired size and are still firm and tender. Pick cucumbers regularly to encourage continued fruit production. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the fruit from the vine, taking care not to damage the plant. Remove any overripe or yellow cucumbers to prevent them from inhibiting further fruit development. Harvest in the morning when fruits are cool and crisp.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store harvested cucumbers in the refrigerator crisper drawer. Cucumbers are best eaten fresh but can also be pickled, sliced, or used in salads and sandwiches. Wash cucumbers thoroughly before consuming. If storing cucumbers for more than a few days, wrap them in paper towels and place them in a plastic bag to help absorb excess moisture and prevent spoilage.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>Popular cucumber varieties include 'Marketmore,' 'Straight Eight,' 'Burpless,' and 'Lemon.' Choose varieties suited to your climate, growing conditions, and intended use (slicing, pickling, or salad). Some varieties are more resistant to pests and diseases than others.</p>
    
    <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
    <p>Cucumbers are low in calories and high in water content, making them a refreshing and hydrating snack. They are also a good source of vitamins K and C, as well as potassium and dietary fiber. Regular consumption of cucumbers may help with hydration, digestion, and weight management.</p>
