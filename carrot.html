    <h1>Carrot Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/carrot.webp" alt="carrot">
    <h2>Planting</h2>
    <p>Carrots thrive in well-drained, loose soil with plenty of organic matter. Plant carrot seeds directly in the garden bed in early spring or late summer, depending on the desired harvest time and local climate. Sow seeds thinly in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart, and cover them lightly with soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate, which usually takes 1-3 weeks. Thin carrot seedlings to 2-3 inches apart once they have several true leaves to allow for proper root development. Carrot seeds can also be mixed with sand or vermiculite to aid in even distribution and prevent overcrowding.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>Carrots require consistent moisture and regular weeding throughout the growing season. Water carrots deeply once a week, providing about 1 inch of water, more during hot, dry weather. Mulch around carrot plants to conserve soil moisture and suppress weeds. Carrots develop best in cool weather, so plant them early in the spring or late in the summer for a fall harvest. Keep an eye out for pests such as carrot rust fly and diseases like carrot rot, and take appropriate measures to manage them. Carrot tops are edible and can be harvested throughout the growing season for fresh greens.</p>
    
    <h2>Fertilization</h2>
    <p>Carrots are not heavy feeders but benefit from a balanced fertilizer applied at planting time. Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to provide essential nutrients. Avoid using fresh manure, which can cause carrots to fork and deform. Side-dress carrots with a balanced fertilizer once or twice during the growing season to ensure continued healthy growth. Avoid over-fertilization with nitrogen, as it can promote excessive foliage growth at the expense of root development.</p>
    
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p>• Weed Control: Keep carrot beds weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients and water. Hand-pull weeds regularly, taking care not to disturb carrot roots. Mulching with straw or shredded leaves can help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.<br>
       • Pest and Disease Management: Monitor carrot plants regularly for signs of pests such as carrot rust fly larvae and diseases like leaf blight. Use row covers to protect young plants from pests, and remove and destroy any infested plants. Practice crop rotation and choose disease-resistant carrot varieties to minimize the risk of pest and disease problems. To deter carrot rust fly, cover carrot rows with fine mesh netting or use floating row covers during peak fly activity periods.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Carrots are ready for harvest when they reach the desired size and color, usually 60-80 days after planting. Gently loosen the soil around carrot roots with a garden fork or trowel, taking care not to damage the roots. Lift carrots from the soil, and remove any attached foliage. Harvested carrots can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks or preserved by freezing or canning. For storage carrots, wait until after the first fall frost to harvest, as cold temperatures improve sweetness and flavor.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store harvested carrots in the refrigerator in a plastic bag or container with the tops removed to prevent moisture loss. Carrots can also be stored in a root cellar or cool, dark location with temperatures around 32-40°F and high humidity. Properly stored carrots can last several months, providing a steady supply of fresh vegetables throughout the year. Check stored carrots regularly for signs of spoilage, and remove any soft or moldy carrots to prevent the spread of decay.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>There are many carrot varieties available, ranging in color from orange and yellow to purple and white. Popular carrot varieties include 'Danvers,' 'Nantes,' 'Imperator,' and 'Bolero.' Choose carrot varieties based on desired flavor, color, size, and suitability to your growing region and climate. Experiment with heirloom varieties and specialty carrots for unique flavors and culinary uses. Baby carrots, which are simply immature carrots harvested early, are also popular for snacking and cooking.</p>
    
    <h2>Propagation</h2>
    <p>In addition to growing carrots from seeds, carrots can also be propagated vegetatively by planting carrot tops. Cut off the tops of harvested carrots, leaving about an inch of stem attached. Place carrot tops in a shallow dish of water, and change the water every few days. Roots will begin to form within a week or two, and the carrot tops can then be planted in soil to grow new carrot plants. This method is a fun way to grow carrots indoors year-round and can be a great educational activity for children.</p>
