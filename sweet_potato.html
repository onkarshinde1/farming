    <h1>Sweet Potato Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/SWEET POTATO.webp" alt="sweet potato">
    <h2>Slips Preparation</h2>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are typically grown from "slips," which are small rooted pieces of a mature sweet potato. Slips are usually purchased from garden centers or can be produced at home by placing sweet potato roots in water until they sprout. Once sprouted, slips are carefully removed from the sweet potato and allowed to develop roots for planting. The process of growing slips can take 6-8 weeks.</p>
    
    <h2>Planting</h2>
    <p>Plant sweet potato slips in well-drained, loose soil after all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 60°F. Dig trenches 6-8 inches deep and space slips 12-18 inches apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart. Place slips horizontally in the trench and cover with soil, leaving the top portion exposed. Planting sweet potatoes on raised beds can improve drainage and soil warmth.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>Once planted, sweet potato vines will spread and grow vigorously throughout the growing season. Sweet potatoes prefer warm temperatures between 70°F and 90°F and full sun. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during dry periods. Mulch around plants with straw or shredded leaves to help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Watering: Sweet potatoes need regular watering, especially during hot, dry weather. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid waterlogging, as this can lead to rot. Water deeply once a week, providing about 1-1.5 inches of water.<br>
       • Fertilization: Sweet potatoes are not heavy feeders but can benefit from a balanced fertilizer or compost applied before planting. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, as they can encourage lush foliage growth at the expense of tuber development. Side-dress with a fertilizer high in potassium, such as 0-0-60, halfway through the growing season to promote tuber development.<br>
       • Soil pH: Sweet potatoes prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.8 and 6.2. Test soil pH before planting and amend as needed with lime or sulfur to achieve the optimal pH range.<br>
       • Pest and Disease Management: Monitor plants regularly for pests such as sweet potato weevils, wireworms, and nematodes. Remove and destroy any infested plants promptly. Practice crop rotation and provide adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of diseases such as root rot and fungal infections. Apply organic insecticides or pesticides as needed, following label instructions carefully.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Sweet potatoes can be harvested once the vines have begun to yellow and die back, typically 90-120 days after planting. Carefully dig up sweet potatoes using a fork or shovel, taking care not to damage the tubers. Allow harvested sweet potatoes to cure in a warm, humid location for 1-2 weeks to improve flavor and storage quality. Cure sweet potatoes at temperatures between 80°F and 90°F with high humidity (85-90%) for best results.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store cured sweet potatoes in a cool, dry location with good ventilation. Avoid storing sweet potatoes in the refrigerator, as cold temperatures can negatively affect flavor and texture. Properly cured and stored sweet potatoes can last several months. Inspect stored sweet potatoes regularly for signs of decay or sprouting, and remove any damaged or sprouted tubers to prevent spoilage.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>Popular sweet potato varieties include 'Beauregard,' 'Covington,' 'Jewel,' and 'Georgia Jet.' Choose varieties suited to your climate, growing conditions, and desired use (baking, boiling, or frying). Some varieties are better suited to certain climates or have specific disease resistance characteristics.</p>
    
    <h2>Propagation</h2>
    <p>In addition to slips, sweet potatoes can also be propagated from "slips" or "runners" that develop from the main plant. These can be carefully removed and rooted in water or planted directly in the soil to produce new sweet potato plants. Propagating sweet potatoes from runners allows for the multiplication of desired varieties and can help maintain genetic diversity in the garden.</p>
    
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are versatile and can be used in a variety of culinary applications. They can be boiled, baked, mashed, or fried and used in both savory and sweet dishes. Sweet potato leaves are also edible and can be cooked and consumed as a nutritious leafy green vegetable. Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants, making them a nutritious addition to any diet.</p>
