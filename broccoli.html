    <h1>Broccoli Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/BROCOLLI.webp" alt="brocolli">
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Broccoli seeds should be sown directly into well-prepared garden soil or started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last expected frost date in your area. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist until germination. Broccoli prefers a slightly acidic soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0.</p>
    
    <h2>Germination</h2>
    <p>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Germination typically occurs within 5-10 days when soil temperatures are between 60-70°F. Once seedlings emerge, provide them with ample light, preferably from grow lights or by placing them in a sunny location. Thin seedlings to 12-18 inches apart when they have two sets of true leaves.</p>
    
    <h2>Transplanting</h2>
    <p>Transplant broccoli seedlings into the garden once they have developed 3-4 true leaves and all risk of frost has passed. Harden off seedlings by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions for 7-10 days before transplanting. Space plants 18-24 inches apart in rows spaced 24-36 inches apart to allow for adequate air circulation.</p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>• Water: Broccoli plants need consistent moisture, so water regularly, especially during dry periods. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid waterlogging. Water deeply, providing 1-1.5 inches of water per week.<br>
       • Fertilization: Fertilize plants with a balanced fertilizer high in nitrogen to promote leafy growth. Apply fertilizer every 3-4 weeks, following package instructions. Avoid excessive nitrogen during head formation to prevent loose heads.<br>
       • Mulching: Mulch around broccoli plants to help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth. Use organic mulches such as straw or shredded leaves. Avoid mulching too close to the stem to prevent rot.<br>
       • Pest Control: Monitor plants regularly for pests such as cabbage worms, aphids, and flea beetles. Handpick larger pests and treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Row covers can also be used to protect plants from pests.<br>
       • Disease Management: Practice crop rotation and provide adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of diseases such as clubroot and downy mildew. Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases.<br>
       • Blanching: For larger, tighter heads, blanch broccoli by gently bending leaves over the developing head once it reaches the size of a quarter. Secure the leaves with a rubber band or twine to exclude light and prevent bitterness.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Harvest broccoli when the central head is firm and tight, but before it starts to flower. Cut the main head at a slant about 5-6 inches below the head. Side shoots will continue to develop after the main head is harvested, providing additional harvests over several weeks. Harvest regularly to encourage continued production.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store harvested broccoli in the refrigerator in a perforated plastic bag or wrapped in a damp paper towel. Broccoli can be stored for up to a week but is best when consumed fresh. Blanch and freeze excess broccoli for longer storage.</p>
