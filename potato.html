    <h1>Potato Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/potato.jpg" alt="potato">
    <h2>Planting</h2>
    <p>Potatoes are typically grown from seed potatoes, which are small tubers saved from the previous season's crop or specially produced for planting. Plant seed potatoes in well-drained soil in early spring after the danger of frost has passed. Space seed potatoes approximately 12-15 inches apart in rows spaced 2-3 feet apart. Plant them 3-4 inches deep with the eyes facing upward to allow for proper sprouting. Choose certified disease-free seed potatoes to minimize the risk of introducing pests and diseases into your potato patch.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>Potato plants prefer cool temperatures and require consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Provide regular irrigation to keep the soil evenly moist, especially during tuber formation. As potato plants grow, mound soil around the stems to encourage additional tuber development and protect developing tubers from sunlight exposure, which can cause them to turn green and become toxic. Monitor plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies, such as yellowing leaves or stunted growth, and adjust fertilization as needed to maintain healthy growth.</p>
    
    <h2>Fertilization</h2>
    <p>Apply balanced fertilizer or compost at planting time to provide essential nutrients for healthy potato growth. Side-dress potato plants with additional fertilizer when they reach 6-8 inches tall to support vigorous foliage and tuber development. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush foliage at the expense of tuber production. Perform soil tests before planting to determine nutrient levels and pH, and amend the soil accordingly to optimize nutrient availability for potato plants.</p>
    
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p>• Pest and Disease Management: Monitor potato plants regularly for pests such as Colorado potato beetles, aphids, and potato leafhoppers. Handpick larger pests and use insecticidal soap or neem oil for control. Practice crop rotation and remove any volunteer potato plants to reduce the risk of diseases such as late blight and early blight. Implement cultural practices such as hilling and proper spacing to promote air circulation and reduce disease pressure.<br>
       • Weed Control: Keep potato fields weed-free to minimize competition for nutrients and water. Cultivate shallowly around potato plants to avoid damaging shallow roots. Mulching with straw or organic materials can help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture. Consider using landscape fabric or plastic mulch to further reduce weed growth and improve soil warmth in cooler climates.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Potatoes can be harvested when the vines have died back and the skins of the tubers have set, usually 2-3 weeks after flowering. Use a garden fork or shovel to carefully dig up the potatoes, being careful not to puncture or bruise the tubers. Harvested potatoes should be cured in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated location for 1-2 weeks to toughen the skin and improve storage quality. Avoid harvesting potatoes when the soil is wet to prevent soil clinging to the tubers, which can promote rot during storage.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store cured potatoes in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area with temperatures around 40-50°F and relative humidity of 85-90%. Avoid storing potatoes in the refrigerator, as cold temperatures can convert potato starches to sugars, affecting flavor and cooking quality. Check stored potatoes regularly for signs of sprouting, rot, or disease, and remove any damaged tubers promptly to prevent spoilage. Properly cured and stored potatoes can be stored for several months, extending the harvest season and ensuring a fresh supply of potatoes year-round.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>There are numerous potato varieties available, each with unique characteristics suited to different culinary uses and growing conditions. Popular potato varieties include 'Russet Burbank,' 'Yukon Gold,' 'Red Norland,' and 'Katahdin.' Choose varieties based on desired texture, flavor, and adaptability to your climate and soil conditions. Experiment with heirloom varieties and specialty potatoes for unique flavors and colors in your culinary creations.</p>
    
    <h2>Propagation</h2>
    <p>Potatoes can also be propagated vegetatively by planting small tubers or pieces of larger tubers with at least one eye or sprout. Cut seed potatoes into pieces with 1-2 eyes each, allowing them to dry for a day or two before planting to reduce the risk of rot. Plant potato pieces in the same manner as whole seed potatoes, ensuring proper spacing and planting depth. Vegetative propagation allows growers to multiply their potato stocks and maintain desired varieties for future plantings.</p>
