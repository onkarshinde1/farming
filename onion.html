    <h1>Onion Crop Growth Cycle</h1>
    <img class="img" src="assets/onion.jpg" alt="onion">
    <h2>Planting</h2>
    <p>Onions can be grown from seeds, sets (small bulbs), or transplants. Plant onions in well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0-7.5. For seed planting, sow seeds directly in the garden bed in early spring or start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. If using sets or transplants, plant them in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked. Space onion plants 4-6 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Avoid planting onions in soil that has recently grown other allium crops, such as garlic or leeks, to minimize the risk of disease transmission.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>Onions prefer full sun and consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Water onions regularly, providing about 1 inch of water per week, more during hot, dry weather. Onions have shallow roots, so mulching around plants can help retain soil moisture and suppress weeds. As onions grow, they form bulbs underground, and the tops start to yellow and fall over when bulbs are mature. Monitor onion growth and adjust watering as needed to prevent stress and encourage bulb development.</p>
    
    <h2>Fertilization</h2>
    <p>Apply a balanced fertilizer with a higher phosphorus content, such as 10-20-10, at planting time to promote strong root development and bulb formation. Side-dress onions with nitrogen fertilizer when they reach about 6 inches tall and again when the bulbs begin to swell. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can delay bulb maturity and lead to soft, poorly storing bulbs. Perform soil tests before planting to determine nutrient levels and pH, and amend the soil accordingly to optimize nutrient availability for onion plants.</p>
    
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p>• Weed Control: Keep onion beds weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients and water. Hand-pull weeds or use shallow cultivation to avoid damaging onion roots. Mulching with organic materials such as straw or shredded leaves can help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.<br>
       • Pest and Disease Management: Monitor onions regularly for pests such as onion thrips, onion maggots, and aphids. Use row covers to protect young plants from pests, and remove and destroy any infested plants. Diseases such as onion rot and downy mildew can be minimized by planting disease-resistant varieties and practicing crop rotation. Avoid overhead irrigation, which can promote fungal diseases, and water onions at the base of the plants to keep foliage dry.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Onions can be harvested when the tops have dried and fallen over. Use a garden fork or trowel to gently lift onions from the soil. Allow harvested onions to cure in a warm, dry, well-ventilated area for 2-3 weeks to toughen the skins and improve storage quality. Once cured, trim the tops and roots of onions and store them in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location. Proper curing and storage conditions are essential for prolonging onion shelf life and maintaining quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store cured onions in mesh bags, crates, or other well-ventilated containers in a cool, dry location with temperatures around 32-40°F and relative humidity of 65-70%. Avoid storing onions near potatoes or other fruits and vegetables that release ethylene gas, as it can cause onions to sprout or spoil prematurely. Check stored onions regularly for signs of sprouting, rot, or disease, and remove any damaged bulbs promptly. Properly cured and stored onions can be stored for several months, providing a steady supply of onions throughout the year.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Varieties</h2>
    <p>There are many onion varieties available, including yellow, red, and white onions, as well as sweet and storage varieties. Popular onion varieties include 'Yellow Sweet Spanish,' 'Red Candy Apple,' 'Walla Walla,' and 'Texas 1015Y.' Choose onion varieties based on desired flavor, size, and storage qualities, as well as suitability to your growing region and climate. Experiment with heirloom varieties and specialty onions for unique flavors and culinary uses.</p>
    
    <h2>Propagation</h2>
    <p>In addition to growing onions from seeds, sets, or transplants, onions can also be propagated vegetatively by dividing larger bulbs into smaller sections. Separate individual onion bulbs into smaller clusters, ensuring each cluster has roots attached. Plant divided onion clusters in well-prepared soil at the same depth as they were previously grown. Vegetative propagation allows growers to multiply their onion stocks and maintain desired varieties for future plantings.</p>
